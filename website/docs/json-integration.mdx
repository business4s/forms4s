# JSON Integration

Forms4s is designed to support any json library but currently only `circe` integration is available.

## Usage

<SbtDependency moduleName={"forms4s-circe"}/>

```scala file=./main/scala/forms4s/example/docs/JsonSupportExample.scala start=start_doc end=end_doc
```

## Limitations

* Currently hydration doesn't work for non-delimited alternatives
* Hydration errors (e.g. unmatched fields) are silently ignored

## Example values

Table below show json extracted from various form elements

<RawMarkdown file="docs/form-state-examples.md"/>
